# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-Multiscale-RNN
Deep learning-based brain tumor classification using a custom Multiscale CNN on MRI images. Built with PyTorch.
# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Multiscale CNN

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying brain tumor types from MRI images using a custom-built Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Multiscale CNN architecture designed for effective feature extraction from medical images
- MRI image classification into tumor categories (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary)
- Real-time training metrics and confusion matrix visualization
- Modular and readable PyTorch implementation
